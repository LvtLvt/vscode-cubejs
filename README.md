# CubeJS Language Server & Parser

----
Light, Fast, Fault Tolerance 



Cubejs can look like normal JavaScript Library. But I think they only used JavaScript grammar and implemented their own compilers and engines. 
Cubejs's own compiler is a structure that is difficult to use in code editors. Therefore, the goal of this project is to create a Cube JS Parser that is lightweight and free of grammar errors.
